The aim of this project is to provide a free, open source, functional starter template for anyone to author content online. I've built the default template to be compatible with images, text, links (styled), and iframe embeds.

### Objectives

1. provide a free resource for the benefit of creators - a web site where they control the content and code
2. build community around project
   - encouraging further development to address the changing needs of creators
   - documentation and educational resources around project code - enabling creators to customize and build their site to fit their needs

## Examples

- link-tree
- web zine / microblog
- photo portfolio / feed
